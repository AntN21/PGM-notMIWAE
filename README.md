# not-MIWAE
Code accompanying the paper [not-MIWAE: Deep Generative Modelling with Missing not at Random Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12871),

Shows how to learn deep generative models with missing data under the MNAR assumption. The notebook 'not-MIWAE-demo.ipynb' introduces the model and training step by step. `task01.py` runs the not-MIWAE and competitors on a UCI dataset.
